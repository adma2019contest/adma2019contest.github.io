title: ADMA 2019 Contest

The ADMA 2019 Contest will be "Robust Automated Event Detection for Mult-Camera Streaming Video Environment". This contest intends to develop robust automated activity detection for a multi-camera streaming video environment. As an essential aspect of this contest, activities will be enriched by person and object detection, as well as recognition at multiple levels of granularity. 

This contest will focus on three major thrusts: 1) Detection of primitive activities occurring in ground-based video collection; Examples include: (1) Person getting into a vehicle, (2) Person getting out of a vehicle, (3) Person carrying object.

2) Detection of complex activities, including pre-specified or newly defined activities; Examples include: (1) Person being picked up by vehicle, (2) Person abandoning object, (3) Two people exchaning an object, (4) Person carrying a firearm.

3) Person and object detection and recognition across multiple overlapping and nonoverlapping camera viewpoints.

This contest will produce a common framework and software prototype for activity detection, person/object detection and recognition across a multi-camera network. The impact will be the development of tools for forensic analysis, as well as real-time alerting for userdefined threat scenarios.

--- Judging Criteria and Metrics

The main scoring metrics was based on activity detection using the weighted probability of missed detection at 0.15 false alarms per minute averaged over activity types. You can find the scoring software here https://github.com/usnistgov/ActEV_Scorer .
