The ADMA 2019 Contest will be "Robust Automated Event Detection for Mult-Camera Streaming Video Environment". This contest intends to develop robust automated activity detection for a multi-camera streaming video environment. As an essential aspect of this contest, activities will be enriched by person and object detection, as well as recognition at multiple levels of granularity. This contest will focus on three major thrusts:
1) Detection of primitive activities occurring in ground-based video collection; 
   Examples include:
   (1) Person getting into a vehicle,
   (2) Person getting out of a vehicle,
   (3) Person carrying object.
2) Detection of complex activities, including pre-specified or newly defined activities;
   Examples include:
   (1) Person being picked up by vehicle,
   (2) Person abandoning object,
   (3) Two people exchaning an object,
   (4) Person carrying a firearm.
